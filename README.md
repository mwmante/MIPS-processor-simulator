# MIPS-processor-simulator

This was a group project for our Computer Architecture class in which we implemented an instruction-level simulator for a single cycle processor with support for arithmetic, logic, load/store and branch instructions. Used C++ to build command line application which read in a file consisting of 32-bit binary instructions and output architectural state after each execution.
